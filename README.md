# Food Paradise

## Overview
This is the class project of CS564 Database Management Systems. The main goal of this project is gaining the experience of building a real world web application from scratch. In this project, we developed a Yelp-like web application, which is called Food Paradise.

## Feature
* Review Restaurant: write, edit reviews and give ratings to a restaurant.
* Check-in Restaurant: check-in the restaurants that users have visited.
* Attend Event: explore and save the events of the restaurants that users are interested in.
* Follow/Unfollow Users: users can follow other users so that they are able to see others' recent activities in the timeline.
* Search: users can search restaurants by the food they like.

## How we built it
We built this web application using Java with Apache Struts2 framework.

* Frontend: develop responsive design using Bootstrap framework.
* Backend
    - deploy our system on Apache Tomcat server
    - database: MySQL
* Data: obtain data of more than 1,000 restaurants in Madison from [Yelp Dataset Challenge](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge).
